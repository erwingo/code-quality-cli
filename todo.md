# TODO
- module and component checker
  - javascript projects
    - everything is modular mindset
      - _fonts (only font files can be here)
      - _css (only css files can be here)
      - _media (only images/videos can be here)
      - _components (can have any of the other files)
      - _helpers (useful functions that can be astracted/constants)
      - _vendors (only external libraries/frameworks can be here)
  - should be able to tell external dependencies of modules and components.
    For example, if a component called Sidebar used a helper function outside
    of his folder, this checker should tell him those dependencies.

# DONE
